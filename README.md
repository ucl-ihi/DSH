# UCL Data Safe Haven

This repository was created to share best practices for working with and within the UCL Data Safe Haven (DSH). 

Most researchers at UCL and the IHI working with patient data in one form or another will have to use the DSH at some point to ensure data security. This means working within the restrictions imposed by the DSH. Code shared in this repository is meant to share tips and tricks to solve commonly encountered problems.
